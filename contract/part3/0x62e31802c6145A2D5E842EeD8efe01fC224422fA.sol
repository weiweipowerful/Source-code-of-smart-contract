/**
 * @notice Swap router functions for Maverick V2.  This contract requires that
 * users approve a spending allowance in order to pay for swaps.
 *
 * @notice The functions in this contract are partitioned into two subcontracts that
 * implement both push-based and callback-based swaps.  Maverick V2 provides
 * two mechanisms for paying for a swap:
 * - Push the input assets to the pool and then call swap.  This avoids a
 * callback to transfer the input assets and is generally more gas efficient but
 * is only suitable for exact-input swaps where the caller knows how much input
 * they need to send to the pool.
 * - Callback payment where the pool calls a callback function on this router
 * to settle up for the input amount of the swap.
